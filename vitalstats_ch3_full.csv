"Notes: The data include primary and general-election expenditures for major party general-election candidates only. The Federal Election Commission included the following disclaimer along with its 1986 data, and Vital Statistics considers it appropriate for all years: ""The small N's and unique nature of some Senate campaigns make all measures of central tendency like averages or medians problematic and, as a result, the Commission would not include tables such as these in its regular release of information."" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a. Includes one or more Independents. Independents are included only if they are incumbents or winning non-incumbents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b. Alan Schlesinger (CT-Rep) is not included in the data. He raised $221,019 and was third in the voting. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c. The Incumbents and Challengers in the category ""Incumbent won with < 60%"" are unbalanced due to the Alaska race which featured a Republican Incumbent and Challenger. The Democrat (McAdams) finished third and is not included. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
